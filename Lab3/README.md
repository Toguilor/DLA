# Working with Transformers in the HuggingFace Ecosystem

## Description
focusing on using the HuggingFace ecosystem to adapt Transformer models (specifically DistilBERT) for sentiment analysis tasks.

## Exercise 1: Sentiment Analysis
The goal was to establish a stable baseline by using a pre-trained DistilBERT model solely as a feature extractor, without modifying its internal weights.
