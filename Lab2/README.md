# Deep Reinforcement Learning Laboratory

## Description
This laboratory focuses on policy gradient methods for **Deep Reinforcement Learning***, with a particular emphasis on the **REINFORCE** algorithm and its variants.
The objective is to understand, implement, and analyze the behavior of policy-based agents on classical control environments from ***Gymnasium***, such as **CartPole** and **LunarLander**.

The lab is structured progressively:
- Implementation of the vanilla REINFORCE algorithm.
- Introduction of a baseline (state-value function) to reduce variance.
- Design of evaluation protocols beyond running averages.
- Empirical analysis of learning stability and performance.

All experiments are implemented in **PyTorch**.
