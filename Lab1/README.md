This repository contains the implementation and experimental analysis of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification, with a focus on:

Training a custom ResNet-like architecture from scratch

Using CNNs as feature extractors

Evaluating representations with classical machine learning baselines (KNN, SVM)

Fine-tuning a pretrained CNN on a more challenging dataset

The experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, following standard deep learning and representation learning practices.
