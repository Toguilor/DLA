# Laboratories of the Deep Learning Application course

In this repository, we have vary laboratory exercises of **Deep Learning Application course**, implementing various neural network architectures and training techniques using PyTorch.

The repository is structured as follow:

## Laboratory 1: Convolutional Neural Networks
1. Methods: MLP, CNNs, ResNet
2. Datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-10

## Laboratory 2: Deep Reinforcement Learning
1. Methods: Policy Gradient
2. Environnement: CartPole, Lunar Lander
